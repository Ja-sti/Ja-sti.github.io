    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am a computer scientist who has worked with python, html, java, c# and c++. Of these skill sets, my strongest is python. In addition to the computer scienc specific skills, I also have a wide range of skills that I find to be generally useful in the workplace and life. The first of these is leadership from my time working as deckhand one on a sailing vessel, as well as from being an officer for the MSU Renessaince Sword Society. The next skill that I have great expertise with is time management, as I feel it is very important to be on-time to everything, as is it to be sure to allow enough time for difficulties to occur.

      - role: Ordinary Crew on the Friends Good Will.
        time: 2021-2023
        company: Michigan Maritime Museum, South Haven Michigan
        details: |
          During my time at the museum, I was an ordinary crew member who got promoted to deck hand two and later deck hand one. In all of these roles, safety was a priority, however as deckhand two, I was given additional responsibility in the event of emeregency as well as being in charge of the watch. As Deck hand one, my role in emergencies was changed to different areas, and I was in charge of making sure all of the crew was following the captain's commands both in and out of emergency situations. In these roles I learned a great deal of leadership skills as well as teamwork as I worked with a crew that had to be well synchronized in order to complete tasks.
